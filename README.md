# Identifying patterns of human behavior: an analysis on experimental data of the Public Goods Game

This repository is a collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks organized according the different chapters and sections of this study. It's major objective is to be useful in the identification of patterns in a collective risk dilemma experimental data. 

The whole code, until 30.08.2018, is the result of a final Master's Thesis of the [Master's Degree in Fundamental Principles of Data Science](http://www.ub.edu/estudis/en/mastersuniversitaris/cienciadades/introduction) supervised by Josep PerellÃ³, PhD. The [Master's Thesis report](https://github.com/axelbrando/Mixture-Density-Networks-for-distribution-and-uncertainty-estimation/blob/master/ABrando-MDN-MasterThesis.pdf) is published in this repository in a PDF format. To summary all the contents I explained in the report, will be possible to consult the [slides of the presentation](). Any contribution or idea to continue the lines of the proposed work will be very welcome.



## Implemented tricks and techniques

> - Classic statistical techniques. 
> - Unsupervised clustering algorithms: K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN and MAP-DP.
> - Selection of the optimal number of clusters based on NbClust ([Malika Charrad et al. 2006](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275463140_Determining_the_number_of_clusters_using_NbClust_package))
> - Supervised classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine.

## Some Python libraries used

> - sklearn
> - scipy
> - pandas
> - collections

## Some R libraries used

> - fitdistrplus
> - NbClust
> - cluster
> - ineq

## Implemented visualisation functionalities

> - Generic implementation to visualise mean and SE (as errorbar) of the most important variables of the Collective-Risk Dilemma game..
> - Generic implementation to visualise the clustering assignment on 2D using PCA.
